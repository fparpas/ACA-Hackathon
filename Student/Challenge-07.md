# Challenge 07 - Jobs in Azure Container Apps

## Introduction
Not every container needs to be a long-running web service. Container Jobs let you run batch or scheduled tasks. In this challenge, you will learn how to deploy a job that processes data and then completes.

## Description
- Define a job using a container image that performs a finite task (e.g., batch processing).
- Schedule the job to run at a specified time using Container Apps scheduling features.
- Check the job output and status.

## Success Criteria
- A job is successfully scheduled and executed.
- The task completes and its output is verifiable.
