# Challenge 10 - Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Introduction
To achieve agile development, it is essential to automate your builds and deployments. In this challenge, you will create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys your container app upon code changes.

## Description
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository.
- Configure the workflow to build your container image and deploy it to Azure Container Apps.
- Test the workflow by pushing a code change and verifying a new deployment.

## Success Criteria
- A GitHub Actions pipeline is established.
- Code changes automatically trigger a build and deployment.
- The container app updates seamlessly based on the CI/CD process.
